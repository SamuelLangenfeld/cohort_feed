App to keep track of social media posted by my bootcamp cohort mates


#To Do

Make separate routes into put and get so that I'm not having to update everytime someone visits the site.

Make a button so anyone can manually update.

Set up a flash notification for successful/unsuccessful update. Put in some bootstrap classes.

Blogs should be a link

Include twitter accounts and personal web sites
